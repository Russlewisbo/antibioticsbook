    "section": "The impact of antibiotics on human health",
    "text": "The impact of antibiotics on human health\nUntil the 20th Century, influenza, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and enteric infections ranked among the leading causes of death. The average lifespan for adults in Western Europe was around 50 years, with a 2% mortality rate for children under the age of 5 due to premature deaths primarily caused by infectious diseases.\nIndustrialization and increasing wealth during the 19th century brought improvements in drinking water and sanitation in many countries, leading to reductions in communicable enteric infections and improved in life expectancy Figure 2.1. By the early 20th century, vaccines for pertussis, diphtheria, yellow fever and tuberculosis were introduced. However, common bacterial infections remained a serious medical threat. Streptococcal throat infections were sometimes fatal, ear infections could progress to deafness, mastoiditis or meningitis. Minor surgeries were associated with risk of life-threatening infections. Maternal mortality during childbirth approached 2%.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Changes in life expectancy over 500 years. Source: World in Data\n\n\nThe introduction of effective antibiotic therapy played a crucial role in further reducing mortality rates associated with common infectious diseases. This breakthrough not only improved the safety of childbirth and common surgical procedures but also paved the way for supportive care during chemotherapy for cancer and transplantation. Thus the discovery of antibiotics can be considered one of the most significant health-related events of modern times.(Davies and Davies 2010)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0.1 Ancient use of antibiotics\nIn nature, some microbes, plants and animals have the ability to produce substances that can inhibit or kill microbes that cause disease or compete for the same resources. These natural products have been the source of many antibiotics and treatments with antimicrobial-like activity over the millennia.\nThe first recorded use of antimicrobial -like substances was by the early Egyptians, Greeks, and Chinese, who used natural products with antimicrobial activity for millennia to treat wounds and infections, even if the causes of these diseases were unknown until the 19th and 20th century (Figure 2.2). Healers of many cultures understood the antimicrobial properties of fungi and their use of moldy bread or other mold-containing products to treat wounds has been well documented for centuries.(Wainwright 1989) Today, while about 80% of the world’s population still relies on plant-derived medicines,(Verma and Singh 2008) scientists are now discovering the active compounds conferring the medicinal benefits contained in many of these traditionally used plants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Recorded use of antimicrobial-like treatments by Chinese (top panel), Egyptians (middle) and Greeks (lower panel). Source: Wikipedia.\n\n\nHowever, even today some of the most effective anti-infective treatments (e.g. artemisinin, which are derivatives from “qinghao” or Sweet Wormwood plant) have been “rediscovered” as effective treatments for severe infectious diseases such as malaria (Figure 2.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: First English-language report of anti-malarial activity of the artemisinins-a traditional Chinese herbal remedy. Artemisinins are now the WHO-recommended front-line treatment for malaria. image course: Chinese Medical Journal\n\n\n\nSimilarly, antibacterial resistance pre-dates the medical use of antibiotics and is estimated to have emerged with bacteria on earth approximately 2-2.5 billion years ago. In contrast, the first humans are believed to have existed around 2 million years ago. Therefore, antibiotic resistance was not created by humans and misuse of antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance can be considered a biologic certainty and evolutionary destiny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0.2 The modern era of antibiotic discovery\nThe microbiologist and immunologist Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915) (Figure 2.4) is credited with introduction of strategic antibiotic discovery that with the chemist Sahachiro Hato lead to the discovery and first medical application of the synthetic antibiotic arsphenamine (Salvarsan) for the treatment of a bacterial infection-syphilis. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1909.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: German immunologist Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915). Image: Library of Congress\n\n\nA few decades later, German scientists Josef Klarer, Fritz Mietzsch, and Gerhard Domagk made a significant discovery regarding the antibacterial properties of a synthetic dye called prontosil (Figure 2.5). They found that it could effectively treat streptococcal and staphylococcal infections in mice. Domagk’s own daughter was one of the first individuals to receive the drug, which successfully cured her severe streptococcal infection caused by a needle jab. Utterly desperate when the doctor recommended amputation to save his daughter’s life, Domagk treated Hildegard with Prontosil, which led to her recovery but she suffered a permanent reddish discoloration of her skin owing to the drug.\nIn recognition of his work with prontosil and sulfanilamide (the active compound derived from prontosil), Domagk was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1939. However, the Nobel committee had angered the German political authorities by awarding the 1935 Nobel Peace Prize to Carl von Ossietzky, an outspoken German pacifist. Under the grip of Hitler and the Nazi Party, German citizens were forbidden to accept the Nobel Prize. After Domagk accepted the prize, he was arrested by the Gestapo and forced to send a letter rejecting it. Although Domagk was able to receive his prize medal in 1947, the prize money had long since been redistributed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Gerhard Domagk (left) and a vial of prontosil (right), the precursor to sulfanilamide antibiotics\n\n\nSulfanilamide, the first synthetic antimicrobial, served as the foundation for the development of a family of sulfa drugs. These successes led to the discovery and production of other important classes of synthetic antimicrobials, such as quinolines and oxazolidinones.\n\n\n2.0.3 The discovery of penicillin\nA few years prior to the prontosil discovery, Alexander Fleming made an accidental but ground breaking finding. In 1928, while examining old plates of staphylococci in his laboratory, Fleming noticed that mold growth (later identified as Penicillium notatum) inhibited the growth of staphylococci on one plate (Figure 2.6). This marked the discovery of penicillin, the first natural antibiotic. Further experiments carried out by Chain and Florey demonstrated penicillin’s antibacterial properties against streptococci, meningococci, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the causative agent of diphtheria.\nWhile Fleming and his colleagues were credited with the discovery and identification of penicillin, its isolation and mass production were achieved by a team of researchers at Oxford University led by Howard Florey and Ernst Chain. In 1940, they purified penicillin and reported its success as an antimicrobial agent against streptococcal infections in mice. Subsequent studies with human subjects also proved penicillin’s effectiveness. For their significant contributions, Fleming, Florey, and Chain were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1945.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Original report of penicillin antimicrobial activity in the British Journal of Pathology 1928. The discovers and developers of penicillin.\n\n\nIn June of 1943 Mary Hunt, a lab assistant working in Peoria, Illinois, found a cantaloupe at a local market covered in mold with a “pretty, golden look.” (Figure 2.7). This mold turned out to be a highly productive strain of Penicillium chrysogeum and its discovery marked a turning point in the quest to mass produce penicillin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Penicillin fermentation (left panel), Douglas Gorsline’s 1948 painting of “Moldy Mary” in Peoria Illinois(center panel), Purported original photograph of the moldy mellon (right panel)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further reading about the history of penicillin development, see the excellent book by Eric Lax: The Mold in Dr. Florey’s Coat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the early 1940s, Dorothy Hodgkin, a crystallography expert at Oxford University, used X-rays to analyze the structure of various natural products. In 1946, she determined the structure of penicillin, earning her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 (Figure 2.8). Knowledge of the penicillin structure allowed scientists to modify penicillin, leading to the development of semisynthetic versions. Semisynthetic antimicrobials are chemically modified derivatives of natural antibiotics, designed to broaden their bacterial targets, increase stability, reduce toxicity, or confer other beneficial properties for treating infections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Dorothy Hodgkin is the biochemist who solved the xray crystal structure of penicillin opening the door for synthesis of semisynthetic penicillins to combat resistance. Image source: www.nobelprize.org\n\n\nPenicillin is just one example of a natural antibiotic. In the 1940s, Selman Waksman, a renowned soil microbiologist at Rutgers University, and his research team discovered several antimicrobials, including actinomycin, streptomycin, and neomycin. These findings stemmed from Waksman’s study of fungi and Actinobacteria, particularly soil bacteria in the Streptomyces genus known for their natural production of diverse antimicrobials (Figure 2.9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Selman Wakesman. Winner, Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1952. Source: Rutgers University\n\n\nWaksman’s contributions earned him the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1952. Actinomycetes, the source of more than half of all natural antibiotics, continue to serve as a valuable resource for discovering novel antimicrobial agents. Some researchers believe that we have yet to fully explore the antimicrobial potential of this group.\nThe term antibiotic was actually coined by Waksman."

    "text": "2.1 History of antimicrobial resistance\nAntimicrobial resistance is a natural occurrence as microbes adapt to overcome antimicrobial compounds produced by other microorganisms. However, the development and widespread use of antimicrobial drugs by humans have added another selective pressure that drives further evolution. Factors such as overuse, misuse, inappropriate use, subtherapeutic dosing, and patient non-compliance and widespread use of antibiotics in food production (livestock can accelerate the evolution of drug resistance. Pathogens can develop resistance through chromosomal mutations that are vertically transferred to subsequent generations or through horizontal gene transfer facilitated by plasmids and transposons, which can promote the spread of resistance.\nCertain organisms, like Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, naturally possess the ability to develop multiple types of resistance. On the other hand, organisms like Klebsiella pneumoniae have historically been treatable but are now becoming highly resistant by acquiring new resistance elements. There are also organisms, such as Streptococcus pyogenes, that have remained susceptible to “old” antibiotics like penicillin since their introduction.\nAntibiotic resistance in bacteria typically originates from specific events. While resistance can arise within a bacterium through random mutations affecting the target of the antibiotic or other essential elements, it is more commonly acquired from other bacteria through the transfer of mobile genetic elements. Bacteria have the ability to exchange genes not only within their own species but also between different species and even genera. The transfer of plasmids, circular DNA structures that can carry multiple genes including those for antibiotic resistance, is a crucial mechanism for gene transmission among bacteria. Plasmids are highly mobile and can encode for various types of resistance that are unrelated, such as resistance to cephalosporins through beta-lactamase production and resistance to fluoroquinolones via efflux pumps. Through this gene swapping process, a bacterium can become resistant to multiple antibiotics.\nPenicillinase (enzymes produced by bacteria that destroy the beta-lactam ring of penicillin) were already reported by 1940 prior to the first clinical use of the drug.(Davies and Davies 2010) Alexander Fleming was among the first physicians to caution about the risks of resistance to penicillin if used too little or for a too short of period during treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It is not difficult to make microbes resistant to penicillin in the laboratory by exposing them to concentrations not sufficient to kill them, and the same thing has occasionally happened in the body. The time may come when penicillin can be bought by anyone in the shops. Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily under-dose himself and by exposing his microbes to non-lethal quantities of the drug make them resistant.”   Sir Alexander Fleming, Nobel Prize Lecture, December 11, 1944"

    "section": "2.3 Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance",
    "text": "2.3 Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance\nThere are several common mechanisms for drug resistance, which are summarized in Figure 2.11. These mechanisms include enzymatic modification of the drug, modification of the antimicrobial target, and prevention of drug penetration or accumulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Overview of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms\n\n\nDrug Modification or Inactivation: Resistance genes can produce enzymes that modify or hydrolyse antimicrobials, rendering them inactive. This mechanism is common in various antimicrobials, such as aminoglycosides and β-lactams. Aminoglycoside resistance can occur through the transfer of chemical groups to the drug molecule, interfering with its binding. β-lactam resistance involves the enzymatic hydrolysis of the β-lactam bond in the drug molecule’s β-lactam ring, leading to loss of antibacterial activity. Rifampin can be inactivated through glycosylation, phosphorylation, or ADP ribosylation, while macrolides and lincosamides can be enzymatically inactivated or modified.\nPrevention of Cellular Uptake or Efflux: Some microbes develop resistance by hindering the accumulation of antimicrobial drugs, preventing them from reaching their targets. Gram-negative pathogens can alter outer membrane lipid composition, porin channel selectivity, or porin channel concentrations. For instance, Pseudomonas aeruginosa reduces the amount of its OprD porin to resist carbapenems. Efflux pumps are produced by many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to actively transport drugs out of the cell, preventing effective drug accumulation. Efflux pumps can confer resistance to β-lactams, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones.\nTarget Modification: Structural changes in antimicrobial drug targets can prevent drug binding, leading to resistance. Spontaneous mutations in genes encoding antibacterial drug targets allow bacteria to develop resistance. For example, changes in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) can inhibit the binding of β-lactam drugs, providing resistance. Streptococcus pneumoniae alters its own PBPs, while Staphylococcus aureus acquires low-affinity PBPs to resist methicillin. Other examples include alterations in ribosome subunits, lipopolysaccharide structure, RNA polymerase, DNA gyrase, metabolic enzymes, and peptidoglycan subunit peptide chains.\nTarget Overproduction or Enzymatic Bypass: In antimetabolite drugs that target specific enzymes, resistance can occur through target overproduction or the development of bypass mechanisms. Microbes may produce excess target enzymes, ensuring enough enzyme activity despite the presence of the drug. Alternatively, they may develop bypass pathways that do not rely on the functional target enzyme. Sulfonamide resistance can occur through these mechanisms. Vancomycin resistance in S. aureus involves decreased cross-linkage of peptide chains in the cell wall, providing more targets for vancomycin binding.\nTarget Mimicry:A recently discovered resistance mechanism called target mimicry involves the production of proteins that prevent drugs from binding to their targets. For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis can develop fluoroquinolone resistance by producing a protein called MfpA, which resembles DNA. MfpA binds to DNA gyrase, preventing fluoroquinolones from binding."

    "text": "2.4 Antibiotic discovery to the rescue\nInitially, antibiotic discovery seemed to keep pace with emerging resistance as a host of new chemical classes were developed and introduced in the 1950s-1980’s. For the first half of the century, the repeated and successful response to emerging resistance was to discover a new class of antibiotics.\nYet by the 1980’s, the discovery of new agents began to slow and this strategy began to fail Figure 2.12. The last truly “new” antibiotic class discovered that reached the market was in 1987. Since then, there has been a lack of innovation in the field, and today there are few novel antibiotic classes in the drug pipeline.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Antibiotic discovery timeline. Source: www.reactgroup.org\n\n\nThe slowdown in new antibiotic development is occurring at a time when resistance, particularly to penicillins and beta-lactam antibiotics is dramatically increasing due to the wide spread and adaptation of enzymes that hydrolyze this drug class-beta lactamases (Figure 2.13).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: Marked increased in beta-lactamases over the last 4 decades. Figure is form Bush et al. (Bush and Jacoby 2010)\n\n\nAntibiotic use in humans in only one of many drivers of antimicrobial resistance, as increasing use of antimicrobials in livestock for growth promotion, of agriculture to prevent spoilage, or release of antimicrobials into the environmental waste-water contributes to the resistome - the total burden of antibiotic resistance genes in the environment (Figure 2.14}. Therefore, strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance have taken on a One Health Approach- i.e. interdisciplinary and collaborative strategies that considers the interconnectedness of human health, animal health, and the environment. This approach promotes cooperation between various sectors, such as human medicine, veterinary medicine, environmental science, and public health, to achieve optimal health outcomes for all.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.14: Modifiable risk factors that drive antimicrobial resistance. Figure form Homes et al.(Holmes et al. 2016)\n\n\nThe consequences of faltering antibiotic discovery are now being felt worldwide as more and more bacterial infections are becoming harder to treat. Especially worrisome is the lack of antibiotics against common Gram-negative bacteria (i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii) that are increasingly resistant to all but last-line antibiotics. The rapid global spread of multi- and pan-resistant bacteria, also known in the lay press as “superbugs,” can cause infections that are not treatable with existing antibiotics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow quickly can antibiotics develop resistance?\n\n\n\nClick this link to watch a YOUTUBE video of how quickly Escherichia coli and develop resistance to ciprofloxacin.\nAnother excellent YOUTUBE video on the crises of antibiotic resistance and the dwindleing antibiotic pipeline was presented by the FRONTLINE Program on the : When Antibiotics Don’t Work"

The plan outlines 21 strategies and 5 strategic objectives action plans that should be implemented in member states to address AMR. These include:\n\nImprovements in the awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance through effective communication, education and training\nStrengthening of knowledge and evidence base of AMR through surveillance and research\nReductions in the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene and infection prevention measures\nOptimization the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health\nDevelopment of an economic case for sustainable investment in AMR research that takes account of the needs of all countries, and increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions\n\nOne aspect of this action plan was the development of Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS). A link the 2022 report can be here\nThe WHO also proposed a Priority Pathogen List for research and development of new antibiotics and established a global antimicrobial use and surveillance program. This list includes bacterial pathogens that are considered to be be the biggest threat to human health in addition to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The WHO list breaks down pathogens into three groups:\n\n\nTable 2.2: WHO priority pathogens\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriority\nPathogens included\n\n\n\n\nCritical\nAcinetobacter baumannii (Carbapenem-resistant)\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (Carbapenem-resistant)\nEnterbacterales (3rd generation cephalosporin, carbapenem-resistant)\n\n\nHigh\nEnterococcus faecium, vancomycin-resistant\nStaphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant, vancomycin intermediate and resistant\nHelicobacter pylori, clarithromycin-resistant\nCampylobacter, fluoroquinolone-resistant\nSalmonella spp., fluoroquinolone-resistant\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae, 3rd generation cephalosporin-resistant, fluoroquinolone-resistant\n\n\nMedium\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-non-susceptible\nHaemophilus influenzae, ampicillin-resistant\nShigella spp., fluoroquinolone-resistant\n\n\n\n\nThese pathogens may exhibit multi-drug resistance (MDR), extensive drug resistance (XDR) or pan-drug resistance (PDR).(Magiorakos et al. 2012) Difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR) is a newer definition used to define isolate resistance patterns that require the use of less-effective or more toxic “reserve” antibiotics- e.g., Acinetobacter baumannii susceptible only to colistin and tobramycin.(Kadri et al. 2018)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do these resistance definitions mean?\n\n\n\nThe resistance definitions used by the WHO have specific meanings.\n\nMDR-resistance to one agent in at least 3 antibiotic categories\nXDR-resistant except to 2 or fewer antibiotic categories\nPDR-resistant to all agents in all antibiotic categories\nDTR-requires the use of less-effective or more toxic “reserve” antibiotics\n\n\n\nCurrently, both the WHO and OIE have also developed lists of antibiotics that are considered of “critical importance” for human and animal medicine.

It involves determining the effectiveness of various antibiotics or antimicrobial agents against specific bacteria or other microorganisms. By conducting this testing, healthcare professionals can make informed decisions about which antibiotics or treatments will be most effective in combating infections. This testing is also performed routinely on large collections of isolates to detect epidemiological trends of resistance (surveillance)."

    "text": "3.2 The concept of antimicrobial spectrum\nThe activity spectrum of an antibacterial drug is related to the range of bacteria it can target. A narrow-spectrum antimicrobial specifically targets certain subsets of bacterial pathogens. For instance, some narrow-spectrum drugs only work against gram-positive bacteria, while others only work against gram-negative bacteria. When the pathogen causing an infection is known, it is generally best to use a narrow-spectrum antimicrobial to minimize harm to the normal microbiota.\nThe bacterial cell wall plays a critical role in defining the spectrum of antimicrobial activity.\n\nGram-positive bacteria have a cell wall consisting of many layers of peptidoglycan totalling 30–100 nm in thickness(Figure 3.1). These peptidoglycan layers are commonly embedded with teichoic acids (TAs), carbohydrate chains that extend through and beyond the peptidoglycan layer. TA is thought to stabilize peptidoglycan by increasing its rigidity. TA also plays a role in the ability of pathogenic gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus to bind to certain proteins on the surface of host cells, enhancing their ability to cause infection.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Gram positive bacterial cell wall. Source: www.biorender.com\n\n\nIn addition to peptidoglycan and TAs, bacteria of the family Mycobacteriaceae have an external layer of waxy mycolic acids in their cell wall. These bacteria are referred to as acid-fast, since acid-fast stains must be used to penetrate the mycolic acid layer for purposes of microscopy\nGram-negative bacteria have a much thinner layer of peptidoglycan (no more than about 4 nm thick) than gram-positive cells, and the overall structure of their cell envelope is more complex (Figure 3.2). In gram-negative cells, a gel-like matrix occupies the periplasmic space between the cell wall and the plasma membrane, and there is a second lipid bilayer called the outer membrane, which is external to the peptidoglycan layer. This outer membrane is attached to the peptidoglycan by murein lipoprotein.\n\nThe outer leaflet of the outer membrane contains the molecule lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which functions as an endotoxin in infections involving gram-negative bacteria, contributing to symptoms such as fever, haemorrhaging, and septic shock.\nEach LPS molecule is composed of Lipid A, a core polysaccharide, and an O side chain that is composed of sugar-like molecules that comprise the external face of the LPS (Figure 3.2). The composition of the O side chain varies between different species and strains of bacteria. Parts of the O side chain called antigens can be detected using serological or immunological tests to identify specific pathogenic strains like Escherichia coli O157:H7, a deadly strain of bacteria that causes bloody diarrhoea and kidney failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Gram negative bacterial cell wall. Source: www.biorender.com\n\n\n\n3.2.1 The Gram-stain test\nThe Gram stain procedure is a widely used differential staining technique that was developed by Danish microbiologist Hans Christian Gram in 1884. It enables the differentiation of bacteria based on the characteristics of their cell walls. Even today, it remains one of the most commonly employed staining methods in microbiology and guiding antibiotic therapy. The steps involved in the Gram stain procedure are as follows (Figure 3.3):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Gram stain procedure. Source: www.biorender.com\n\n\n\nThe first step involves applying crystal violet, a primary stain, to a heat-fixed smear. This primary stain imparts a purple colour to all the cells on the slide.\nGram’s iodine, an essential component called a mordant, is added as the second step. A mordant acts as a fixing agent, and in this context, Gram’s iodine acts as a trapping agent that forms complexes with the crystal violet. These complexes accumulate in the thick peptidoglycan layers of the cell walls.\nThe third step involves adding a decolourising agent, which is typically ethanol or an acetone/ethanol solution. The decolourising agent has a different effect on cells with varying thicknesses of peptidoglycan layers. Those cells with thick peptidoglycan layers are less affected by the decolourising agent, allowing them to retain the purple crystal violet dye and appear purple. In contrast, cells with thinner peptidoglycan layers are more easily decoulorised and lose the crystal violet stain, appearing colourless.\nFinally, a secondary counterstain, usually safranin, is applied. Safranin stains the decolourised cells pink, allowing them to be more easily visualized. However, cells that still contain the retained crystal violet dye are less noticeable since the purple colour masks the pink stain of the counterstain.\n\nClinicians use Gram stain results prior to definitive pathogen identification along with knowledge of the most likely pathogens associated with the clinical presentation/differential diagnosis of infection in the patient to select antimicrobial therapy. Spectrum of activity tables such as those compiled in the Sanford Guide and accessible in cell phone applications can be consulted to select an antimicrobial therapy with appropriate spectrum of activity (Figure 3.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Screenshot of an antimicrobial spectrum of activity table from the Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy cellphone application.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Why not prescribe the broadest-spectrum antimicrobial for all infections?\nSome broad-spectrum antibiotics can target a wide variety of bacterial pathogens, including both gram-positive and gram-negative species. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy may be used as empiric therapy while waiting for laboratory identification of the infecting pathogen.\nBroad-spectrum antimicrobials are frequently used for polymicrobic infections (infections with multiple bacterial species), infectious in immunocompromised patients (where the spectrum of potential pathogens is larger), and for prophylactic prevention of infections for certain surgeries or invasive procedures. In some cases, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial may be chosen to treat an infection when a narrow-spectrum drug fails due to the development of drug resistance by the target pathogen.\nHowever, using broad-spectrum antimicrobials comes with the risk of also targeting a wide range of normal microbiota (Figure 3.5). This increases the risk of a superinfection, which is a secondary infection that occurs in a patient who already has a pre-existing infection. Therefore, we generally want to use the narrowest spectrum of activity appropriate for the type of infection for the shortest period as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Antimicrobial effects on the human microbiota. Source:www.biorender.com\n\n\nSuperinfection can happen when the antibacterial intended for the original infection kills off the protective microbiota, allowing another pathogen that is resistant to the antibacterial to multiply and cause a secondary infection. Examples of superinfection that can develop due to antimicrobial usage include yeast infections (candidiasis), multidrug resistant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, and pseudomembranous colitis caused by Clostridium difficile, which can be life-threatening."

    "text": "3.3 Bactericidal versus bacteriostatic activity\nAntibacterial drugs can have different effects on target bacteria. Some drugs are bacteriostatic, meaning they temporarily inhibit bacterial growth, but the bacteria can resume growth once the drug is eliminated. On the other hand, bactericidal drugs actually kill the target bacteria.\nThe choice between using bacteriostatic or bactericidal drugs depends on factors such as the type of infection and the patient’s immune status. In patients with strong immune defences, both types of drugs can be effective in achieving a clinical cure. However, for immunocompromised patients, using a bactericidal drug is crucial for successfully treating infections.\nIn the case of life-threatening infections like acute endocarditis or meningitis, bactericidal antibiotics are generally favoured. However, in recent years the dogma of “bactericidal activity” has been questioned by some infectious diseases specialists as limited data support the superiority of outcomes for regimens defined as bactericidal versus bacteriostatic in them microbiology laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs bactericidal activity clinically important?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the commonly held belief that bactericidal activity is crucial for certain infections actually challenged by clinical outcome data, as suggested by this analysis conducted by Wald-Dickler and colleagues?"

    "text": "3.4 Antimicrobial susceptibility testing- The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)\nAntimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) can be broadly characterized as phenotypic vs. genotypic methods. The tests are further characterized whether the results produce qualitative or quantitative results.\nPhenotypic assays detect bacterial cell growth arrest or death in the presence of an antimicrobial therefore allowing true susceptibility testing and can be categorized into either minimal inhibitory con- centration (MIC) or non-MIC methods. Quantitative MIC methods (e.g., broth dilution, agar dilution, and agar gradient diffusion) express results numerically, whereas qualitative non-MIC methods (e.g., disk diffusion) allow for broad categorization by interpretive criteria into susceptible, susceptible-dose dependent, intermediate, non-susceptible or resistant interpretive categories without an MIC value.\nRegardless of the method used, traditional phenotypic AST is the final step in the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of clinical microbiology. From specimen collection to Gram stain, organism identification, and AST, the median time is 19 hours, 43 hours, and 65 hours, respectively, for the standard blood culture processing workflow using conventional methods.\nGenotypic AST identifies resistance genes via molecular methods and serves as a surrogate for AST, although susceptibility must be confirmed phenotypically. The main advantage of genotypic AST is rapidity in detection of resistance mechanisms that can allow for earlier modification of therapy.\nThe mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) is a measure of the effectiveness of an antimicrobial agent in inhibiting the growth of microorganisms. It represents the lowest concentration of a specific antimicrobial substance that prevents visible growth of a microorganism after a specified period of incubation-typically 24 hours.\n\n3.4.1 Broth-based MIC testing methods.\nAlexander Fleming developed the first liquid media dilution-based testing method and was a pioneer in the field of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) more than a decade before the penicillin he discovered was available for clinical use. Manual broth microdilution (BMD) is one of the gold standard reference methods per the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and other organizations, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST).\nTo determine the MIC using broth-based methods, a standardized inoculum of the bacterial is prepared. The inoculum of bacteria is prepared using a turbidity meter instrument against a turbidity standard (typically 0.5 McFarland which represents approximately 1-2 x 108 colony forming units (CFU)/mL of inoculum when plated on agar. After dilution, the typical final test inoculum is 5x 105 CFU/mL. The intial inoculum can be confirmed by serial dilution if necessary (Figure 3.6). This standard inoculum is then inoculated into a series of tubes that contain serial dilutions of the antimicrobial agent (Figure 3.7). After the inoculum is added the tubes are incubated at 35°C for at least 18 hours and inspected for growth (Figure 3.8). Growth may also be interpreted visually or by using a spectrophotometer or similar device to detect turbidity or a colour change if an appropriate biochemical substrate that changes colour in the presence of bacterial growth is also included in each well.\nThe test can be performed in testubes (macrobroth) or microtitre trays (microbroth). The latter is more common because it is simplier to setup and wastes less drug and media.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Serial dilution to confirm inoculum. Image source: www.biorender.com\n\n\nThe lowest concentration at which no visible growth is observed is considered the MIC. When samples of clear wells (no visible growth) are plated on antibiotic-free agar, the first clear well that fails to produce growth on agar is considered the mean bactericidal concentration (MBC). This does not mean the MBC culture endpoint is sterile, no organisms, rather the remaining viable inoculum at the MBC endpoint is sufficiently low (i.e. less than 1x 102 CFU/mL) such that plating on drug-free agar with a sterile loop (10 μL) will not result in measurable CFUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Procedure for testing the mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) and mean bactericidal concentration (MBC). Source: www.biorender.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: Example of microdilution broth susceptibility testing. In this example, the plate has rows with clindamycin, penicillin, and erythromycin indicated on the left. The drug concentrations increase from left to right. The lowest concentrations that inhibited visible growth for penicillin and erythromycin are indicated by red circles: 0.06 μg/mL for penicillin and 8 μg/mL for erythromycin. For clindamycin, visible bacterial growth was observed at every concentration up to 32 μg/mL, indicating a MIC of &gt;32 μg/mL. Credit CDC and Openstax.\n\n\nDisk diffusion (Kirby-Bauer) agar-based methods are simpler to perform and can produce reliable MICs, but are not as quantitative and broth-based methods and may not be suitable for some antibiotics that do not diffuse well through the agar.\nThis method involves placing a disk containing a fixed concentration of antimicrobial onto an agar plate that has been inoculated with standardized bacteria. After incubation, the diameter of the zone of inhibition is measured. While disk diffusion is accurate, it does not provide an MIC value, which is important for dose optimization in certain cases. Therefore, disk zone measurements must be correlated with MIC values obtained through other methods, such as BMD, when establishing and updating clinical breakpoints to minimize errors in categorization (i.e. susceptible, intermediate or resistant).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing on solid media\n\n\nA method related to the Kirby-Bauer method uses strips imprinted with a gradient of antimicrobials. Several commercial products (Etest, Biomerieux: Liofilchem, Liofilchem diagnsotica) are available. The Etest is an alternative method for determining MIC (Figure 3.10). It combines the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test and dilution methods. Instead of circular disks, plastic strips with a gradient of an antibacterial are placed on an agar plate inoculated with bacteria. The drug diffuses into the agar, creating an elliptical zone of inhibition. The intersection of the zone with the drug gradient indicates the MIC. Multiple antimicrobials can be tested simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10: Etest method for susceptibility testing. (Left) design of the gradient strips. (Right) results of six antibiotics.

Microorganisms are multiplying without addition of an antimicrobial (growth control), and their amplified bio- mass is detected by MALDI-TOF MS after the incubation. The same holds true for resistant microorganisms that are growing despite the presence of the antimicrobial. In contrast, microorganisms that are susceptible to the tested antimicrobial are inhibited, and their originally inoculated, not-amplified biomass cannot be detected by a MALDI-TOF MS instrument (Fig. 2). The sensitive detection of biomass by MALDI-TOF MS allows incubation times to be considerably shortened in comparison to the reference method"
